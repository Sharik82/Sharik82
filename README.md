### 🐾 Hey there! I'm Denys — a junior web developer turning my love for animals into code.

🔧 Currently, I'm working on my pet project **"4 Paws"** — a fully functional online pet store with a catalog, shopping cart, filters, registration, admin panel, and checkout system.

💡 Built from scratch using:
- **Flask + Python** (backend)
- **HTML/CSS/JS** (frontend)
- **SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL/SQLite** (database)
- **Jinja2, sessions, API, admin interface, authentication**

🎯 I'm learning and practicing at the same time — from database design to interactive UX. The project already has 20+ pages and the UI is inspired by MasterZoo.

🛠️ All on GitHub. Check out the code — structured, commented, and growing.
